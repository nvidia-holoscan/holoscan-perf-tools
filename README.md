# Holoscan Performance Tools

**This repository is now archived and deprecated in favor of [Holohub benchmarks](https://github.com/nvidia-holoscan/holohub/tree/main/benchmarks)**

This repository contains a collection of tools meant to help measure performance
of the NVIDIA Holoscan SDK and platforms. Note that this repository was tested on
[Clara AGX devices only](https://github.com/nvidia-holoscan/holoscan-docs/blob/main/devkits/clara-agx/clara_agx_user_guide.md).

Each subdirectory contains a different tool; see the README file in each
subdirectory for information about that tool.
